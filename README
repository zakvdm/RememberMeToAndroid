RememberMeTo
************
With RememberMeTo, you can tell your phone:
* Remember me to book my leave at work OR 
* Remember me to phone grandpa tomorrow

RememberMeTo waits until the right time (or place) and then remembers you. It's the easiest way to never forget again. After all, why be reminded when you can be remembered?

ROADMAP:
Initially only 1 screen for adding RememberMeTos (no list views!). Only timed remembers at first, then places later.

IDEAS:
Attach photos to a RememberMe.
Attach a location.
Record voice reminders.
Integrate with Google calendar.
